Exploratory Data Analysis

            Exploratory data analysis is a process of performing initial investigations on data.so, as to discover patterns to spot anomalies,to test assumptions ,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with th help of summary statistics and graphical representations link text

In data analysis we wiil analysze to find following insights from the dataset

In data analysis we wiil analysze to find following values
(1)Missing values
(2)Numerical calues
(3)Categorical Values
(4)Distribution of the numerical values
(5)cardinolity of categorical variables
(6)Outliers
(7)Relationship between dependent and independent variables


1.Missing Values

     Missing values or Null Values Present in the dataset
     
2.Numerical values

Numerical values are digits values present in the dataset


3.Categorical values:

which is not a digit values,it represents one of the characterisitic of the dataset

4.Temporal Variables:
     Temporal variables are time and functions of time, dummies associated with time intervals and points in time, and measures of phenomena that vary over time or index temporal environments. Here 'YearBuilt','YearRemodAdd','YrSold','GarageYrBlt' are Temporal Variables
     
5.Types of Numerical Values:
  continuous Variables
  Discrete Varuiables
  
  
  
**(i)Discreate variables**

Discrete variables are countable in a finite amount of time. For example, we can count the change in our pocket, money in the bank account.

**(ii)Continuous Variables**

 continuous variable is a variable whose value is obtained by measuring.
 
 
 Logrithimic Transformation

When our original continuous data do not follow the bell curve, we can log transform this data to make it as “normal” as possible so that the statistical analysis results from this data become more valid. From above visuvalization we can know that some features of our data didn't follow bell curve ,so we are going to use logerthimic distribution


6.Outliers

Outliers are the data that are distant away from the all other observation or unusual data that doesn’t fit the data. In other words, outliers are the data that does not fit the mainstream of data.
